# PID-control-of-twolink-robotic-arm
Developed a PID control system for two-link robotic arm in SIMULINK/MATLAB

twolinkDynamics.slx is the main file  which twolink robotic arm is  tracking circular motion using PID control.
simulink.PNG  is the image of the simulink model design for PID control of twolink robotic arm.
trajectory.m contains the trajectory which the robot is provides (circular trajectory).

plots.m is used to generate the results after tracking the trajectory provided to the robot.

rest of the png's are the tracking results.
